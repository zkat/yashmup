CFFI SDL_gfx Wrapper and sample code

I have tested the bindings and examples using Lispworks Personal Edition 4.4.6. However these 
bindings should work on any lisp with a working ASDF and CFFI.

1) To use sdl-gfx: 
1.1) Start asdf.
1.2) Start cffi; 
		(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :cffi)
1.3) Start lispbuilder-sdl;
		(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :lispbuilder-sdl)
1.3) Start lispbuilder-sdl-gfx;
		(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :lispbuilder-sdl-gfx)
1.4) The location of the SDL_gfx.dll binary must be specified:
1.4.1) If SDL_gfx.dll is compiled manually, then the location of the SDL_gfx DLL must be set using;
        	(setf *sdl-gfx-binaries-user-path* #P<path_to_SDL_gfx.dll>)
       where <path_to_SDL_gfx.dll> is of the format "C:/SDL_gfx-2.0.13/lib/SDL_gfx".
       Please note the forward-slash directory separator, even for Windows.
1.4.2) Precompiled binaries for SDL_gfx are available in ASDF-installable packages as part of 
       this project (lispbuilder) on Sourceforge. For example, a win32 compatible DLL is located in
       the 'lispbuilder-sdl-gfx-binaries_v2.0.13.zip' package. 
       If the asdf-installable package lispbuilder-sdl-gfx-binaries is used, then the binary will be
       installed and loaded automatically using:
		(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :lispbuilder-sdl-gfx-binaries)
	
2) To execute any of the example applications;
2.1) Start lispbuilder-sdl-gfx-examples; 
		(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :lispbuilder-sdl-gfx-examples)
2.2) Run the examples using:
		(sdl-gfx-examples:inbuilt-font)
		(sdl-gfx-examples:random-circles)


3) To create the SDL_gfx CFFI wrappers using SWIG;
3.1) Copy sdlswig.i (the swig interface file) to the SDL_gfx directory.
3.2) Run 'swig -cffi sdlswig.i'
