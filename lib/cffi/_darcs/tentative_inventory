[Add the ability to specify a preprocessor symbol as the argument to :count in cstruct

[manual: miscellaneous improvements
Luis Oliveira <loliveira@common-lisp.net>**20081230014538
 
 - use a roman font for comments in the TeX outputs.
 - fix some typos and missing @lispcmt{}s.
 - insert page breaks before each CLHS-style documentation node.
   This should make it much clearer to read and browse, at the
   expense 23 more pages in total, a ~25% increase.

[Add note about FREE-TRANSLATED-OBJECT's PARAM argument.

[Apply translators to FOREIGN-SLOT-VALUE on aggregate slots
Luis Oliveira <loliveira@common-lisp.net>**20081231014850
 
 Implemented a new generic function TRANSLATE-AGGREGATE-TO-FOREIGN to
 support (SETF FOREIGN-SLOT-VALUE) for aggregate slots.
] 
[Improvements to the :ARRAY type.
Luis Oliveira <loliveira@common-lisp.net>**20081231015145
 
 - Got rid of the :AUTO-ARRAY type. Add translators to :ARRAY
   directly instead.
 - Make the :ARRAY type aggregate. This way it can be used
   inside structures as an alternative to the :COUNT slot option.
 - Add TRANSLATE-AGGREGATE-TO-FOREIGN method that lets us do
   (setf (foreign-slot-value ptr 'struct 'slot-name) #(1 2 3))

[cffi-allegro: WITH-FOREIGN-POINTER bug fix
Luis Oliveira <loliveira@common-lisp.net>**20090108215416
 
 - Pass :ALLOCATION :FOREIGN-STATIC-GC to FF:WITH-STACK-FOBJECT so that
   the allocated object is not moved by the GC in those situation where
   W-S-F does heap allocation (e.g. in interpreted code).

[cffi-allegro: fix handling of pointers on 64-bit platforms
Luis Oliveira <loliveira@common-lisp.net>**20090109013237
 
 - Use :UNSIGNED-NAT instead of :FOREIGN-ADDRESS for CFFI's :POINTER.
 - Cleanup some of the kludges needed because :FOREIGN-ADDRESS wasn't
   understood by Allegro's FF in some contexts.

[cffi-allegro: use WITH-STATIC-FOBJECT instead of WITH-STACK-FOBJECT
Luis Oliveira <loliveira@common-lisp.net>**20090109014509
 
 - WITH-STACK-FOBJECT doesn't take care of deallocation when it fails
   to allocate on the stack.
 - Clean up the WITH-FOREIGN-POINTER macro.

   CFFI-SYS and remove shareable vector tests from the expected failures
   list.
 
 Fix courtesy of John Fremlin.
